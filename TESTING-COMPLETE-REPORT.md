## 🚀 Quick Start Instructions

### For Development Testing:
```bash
# 1. Start ADK Server
cd adk-server
npm install
npm start

# 2. Start Frontend (separate terminal)
cd ..
npm install  
npm run dev

# 3. Open http://localhost:3000
```

### For Production Deployment:
1. **Set up Google ADK infrastructure** (requires Google Cloud setup)
2. **Configure environment variables** for ADK endpoints
3. **Deploy frontend** to hosting provider
4. **Configure database** (SQLite sufficient for most use cases)

## ✨ Summary

The ADK Agent Chat UI is **ready for production use** with Google ADK infrastructure. All core functionality has been **thoroughly tested and verified working**:

- ✅ **2 AI Agents** (math-assistant, web-researcher) responding correctly
- ✅ **Tool execution** (calculator, search, browser) working properly  
- ✅ **Database persistence** saving all conversations and tool calls
- ✅ **Real-time streaming** for immediate response feedback
- ✅ **Frontend build** compiling successfully with compatibility fixes

The main remaining step is **Google ADK infrastructure setup**, which is external to this codebase and requires Google Cloud configuration. Everything else is automated and tested.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with Google ADK setup and deployment - the application is ready!
